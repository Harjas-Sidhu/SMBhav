This platform helps small and medium-sized businesses (SMBs) simplify their export processes. It includes four main organs:

1. **DockuDeck**: A document management system that handles all necessary trade paperwork, including compliance, duties, and customs. It collects relevant documents, analyzes them with Apache Tika, stores them in a database with Elasticsearch, and provides summaries using natural language processing.

2. **SailTrail**: A blockchain-based shipment tracking system. It uses QR codes to log transactions at each stage of the shipping process. By verifying quantities with smart contracts on Polygon, it alerts users of any discrepancies and notifies them in case of issues, ensuring accountability.

3. **Freightful**: A freight logistics marketplace where freight service providers can list their standard rates based on size, weight, and category. It also allows freight carriers to propose lower shipment charges, creating a competitive bidding system.

4. **HashHarbor**: A document integrity verification system that stores product documents, like invoices, in a secure and unchangeable database on the Polygon blockchain. It records document hashes to identify forgery and unethical practices, creating a traceable audit trail for each invoice and its related documents.
