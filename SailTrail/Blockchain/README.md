## Project Structure
- `artifacts/`: Contains build artifacts generated by Hardhat.
- `cache/`: Contains cache files created by Hardhat.
- `contracts/PackageContract.sol`: Solidity smart contract source file.
- `test/PackageContract.js`: JavaScript test file for the smart contract.
- `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration file for the Hardhat project.
- `package.json`: Contains project metadata and dependencies.
- `package-lock.json`: Locks the versions of project dependencies.
- `README.md`: Project documentation file.
## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:Harjas-Sidhu/SMBhav.git
    cd SMBhav/SailTrail/Blockchain
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3. Compile the smart contracts:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat compile
    ```
4. Run tests:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat test
    ```
5. Deploy the smart contract (ensure to configure the network in `hardhat.config.js`):
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>
    ```
