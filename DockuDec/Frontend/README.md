# Frontend

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.0.7.

### Steps to Set Up and Run DockuDeck:

1. Clone the Repository
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Clone the repository from your version control system (GitHub, GitLab, etc.) using the git clone command. Make sure to replace REPO_URL with your actual repository URL.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Harjas-Sidhu/SMBhav.git
 ```
2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, navigate into the project folder:

```bash 
cd SMBhav/docku-deck/frontend
```
3. Install Dependencies
Install all the necessary dependencies listed in the package.json file using npm (Node Package Manager). This will fetch all the libraries and packages required for the Angular app.


```bash 
npm install 
```

4. Set Up Environment Variables (Optional)
If your project requires API keys, database credentials, or any other sensitive information, create an .env file in the root directory and add those details. For example:
```
API_KEY=your-api-key
DB_URI=your-database-uri
``` 
If your project uses different environments (like development, staging, production), ensure the necessary environment-specific configurations are in place. Angular uses the ```src/environments``` folder for this. 

5. Start the Development Server
Run the following command to start the Angular development server:
```bash
ng serve --open 
```
This command will:
Compile the Angular application.
Launch the development server at http://localhost:4200/ in your default web browser.
The --open flag automatically opens the browser window.

6. Verify the Application is Running
After running the development server, go to ``` http://localhost:4200/ ``` in your browser to verify that DockuDeck is up and running. You should see the applicationâ€™s homepage or the default page set up in Angular.

7. Optional: Build for Production
If you're ready to build the application for production, use the ng build --prod command:

```bash 
ng build --prod
 ```
This will create a dist/ folder with all the production-ready files that can be deployed to a web server.

8. Commit Changes (Optional)
If you make any changes and want to push them to the repository, follow these steps:
bash
```bash 
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main
```
